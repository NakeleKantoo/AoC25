# Advent of Code 2025
This is my personal solutions of AoC25, done in Lua

To run any of my code, please use Lua 5.4

The code is separated into `partone.lua` and `parttwo.lua` for the respective halfs of each day's puzzle

There are some comments detailing some of my logic but I mostly just coded and did not document it so roam around at your own risk.
